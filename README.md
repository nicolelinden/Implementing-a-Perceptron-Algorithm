Implementing a Perceptron Algorithm


For my Computational Modeling class, I was tasked with implementing a perceptron algorithm-- a strategy that can be used to teach a computer how to recognize images as digits. To complete this assignment, I was given: 
"a function to read image files (load_image_files) of
a given digit (n), from a provided path (path=â€¦), convert them to a numpy matrix, and finally flatten
that numpy matrix into a vector. The function load_image_files returns all of the vectors corresponding
to pixels in handwritten digits of n from the MNIST dataset. "
